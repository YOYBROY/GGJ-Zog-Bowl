I am setting Thought! to have a world render alignment so that it stays in the same direction,
the view alignment was rotating the images the wrong way
Can be changed under the Renderer tab if you need to change it (down the bottom)

To rotate the actual particle, change 3D Start Rotation to the correct orientation (it's at the top)
I think you can also just put it in an empty and move/rotate that...?
(idk how your programming works sorry i just make it somewhat pretty)

You may need to go into the prefab and adjust the position based on the camera if they are not sitting right
